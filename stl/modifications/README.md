# Modifications

In this folder you'll find the stl files for modifications that some users did. These modifications make Thor easier to print (split parts or smaller modifications). 

* [Danny-VdH](https://github.com/Danny-VdH) - Art2BodyASmall, Art2BodyBSmall, Art2BodyBCoverSmall & Art4Body modifications
* [Ctrl-Alt-Dude](http://www.thingiverse.com/ctrl-alt-dude/about) - BaseBot190mm modification
* Art1Body7mmDiameterStepper.stl - Most 5.18:1 stepper motors have 7mm shafts, the original Body1 is 6mm. This file changes the gap to 7.2mm so you can slide the stepper motor shaft easily into Body1.

Thank you guys ;)
